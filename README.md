# The AI & Robotics SME Glossary

Welcome to my personal AI & Robotics Glossary. This repository is a curated, living document of the key terms, concepts, and acronyms that form the language of modern robotics and artificial intelligence.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The goal of this glossary is to serve two primary purposes:

1.  **A Knowledge Base:** To solidify my own understanding of core concepts by articulating them in a clear and concise manner.
2.  **A Professional Resource:** To provide context for the technologies and methodologies used in my other portfolio projects, demonstrating a deep and thorough understanding of the field.

This document is a foundational component of my journey to becoming a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in AI and Robotics.

## ðŸ”— Integration

Terms defined in this glossary are linked from the `README.md` files of my other projects. This creates a cohesive and interconnected professional portfolio.
